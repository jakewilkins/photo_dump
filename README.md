# PhotoDump

Getting photos out of iOS and into something I own.

Right now, baby steps, is working with an IFTTT recipe running the IF app and
the Maker channel which will make a POST request to this app and store the data.

Next steps are downloading the photo from IFTTT, then from there cutting out the
middleman of the IF app and posting directly here.
